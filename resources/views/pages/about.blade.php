        <p>hELP is a web-based information system whose purpose is to help people by answering their questions about several topics from law to economics.</p>
        <p>It is being developed by a group of four students with the guidance of the teachers of the LBAW course who stipulated the project, all of whom constitute the stakeholders.</p>
        <p>This website is made for everyone who has questions and is not sure where to find the answer or is too afraid to ask them in person.</p>
        <p>Thus, this platform aims to spread different perspectives and approaches about topics that may not be as accessible to anyone trying to improve their knowledge in these unclear topics.</p>
        <p>The main goal of this platform, besides the mutual help between individuals, is to create a community of active users - people that write/answer questions - who create trustworthy content for anyone interested. In that way, both active people and visitors can find their answers in hELP.</p>
